## How to use this repository
After installing macports you need a modern version of `git`\
git clone the repository into /opt then follow [4.6. Local Portfile Repositories](https://guide.macports.org/#development.local-repositories)\
Next run `port -v sync` you can now install any of the provided Ports.

### Force x86_64
Due to macports-ports bugs we need to force MacPorts to only install for x86_64
