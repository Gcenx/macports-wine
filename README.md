## How to use this repository
After installing macports you'll need a modern version of `git`\
git clone the repository into /opt then follow [4.6. Local Portfile Repositories](https://guide.macports.org/#development.local-repositories)\
Next run `port -v sync` you can now install any of the provided Ports.

## macOS Mojave;
Add the following into `/opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf`
```
macosx_deployment_target     10.13
macosx_sdk_version           10.13
```
This enables the `i386` & `x86_64` architectures thus enabling the `+universal` flag\
Next place a copy of the `MacOSX10.13.sdk` into `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/` \
Alternatively run `port install MacOSX10.13.sdk`

## macOS Catalina or later;
`wine-stable`, `wine-devel` & `wine-staging` will only provide wine64.
