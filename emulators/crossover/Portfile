long_description        ${name} runs thousands of different Windows apps \
                        on your Mac. From productivity, utility, games, \
                        and design software-Windows software never looked \
                        better when launched right from the macOS dock with \
                        {name} Mac. Easily switch between Mac or Windows \
                        programs without rebooting, without using a virtual \
                        machine and without purchasing a Windows license. \
                        The best solution to run Windows programs on Mac \
                        is with native functionality like copy & paste, \
                        keyboard shortcuts, Mission Control, and more!
